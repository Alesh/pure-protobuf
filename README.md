protobuf
========

My own implementation of [Google](http://www.google.com)'s [Protocol Buffers](http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/encoding.html).

What and why
------------

I've written this just4fun, thus all questions like "What's the goal?" have no any sense.

Fow now, there is full protobuf encoding implementation, so you can use the `encoding` module with full compatibility with the standard implementation.

The `encoding` module is covered with unit tests, but you should understand that there are may be some unknown bugs. *Thus, use this software at your own risk.*
